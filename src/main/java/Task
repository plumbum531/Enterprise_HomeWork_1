Implement the Strategy pattern for compressing the incoming OutputStream.

- The output should be a compressed OutputStream depending on the zip/gzip algorithm chosen

- Use lambda constructions

- How the data source is selected, the choice of the algorithm (interactive console, launch, config, ..) at your discretion

*Note: for the zip algorithm, be sure to specify the file name in the archive:

((ZipOutputStream) out).putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(..));
